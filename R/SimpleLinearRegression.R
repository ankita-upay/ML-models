# into train and test subsets.
# (0<=splitratio<1)
# In R the split Ratio is for traing set

# False if for test_set

# Linear regression Model
regressor = lm(formula=Salary ~ YearsExperience,

#information about the regressor
summary(regressor)
# coefficient here shows the statistical significance 
# no * means thats there no statistical signifance whereas 
# *** means higher statistical significance 
# The lower the P value more significant your independent 
# variable is going to be 
# When P value is over 5% means that its less significant, 
# lower P value means highly significant

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = predict(regressor,new_data=test_set)
